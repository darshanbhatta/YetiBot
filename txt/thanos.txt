Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the universe. But this… does put a smile on my face.
When I’m done, half of humanity will still exist.
You’re strong. But I could snap my fingers, and you’d all cease to exist.
The end is near.
I know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Snap.
Who would have thought that becoming God would be such a hollow victory.
The Universe will now be set right. Made over to fit my unique view of what should be.
This universe is finite. Its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to…
Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other.
